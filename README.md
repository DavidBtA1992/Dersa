//4mA-20mA CURRENT SENSOR WITH WIFI COMMUNICATION
//This is an easy code used to measure low currents in control loops using a INA219 monitor and a Nodemcu V3 Wi-Fi module. This project
//will be initially tested in our liquid detergent plant in order to evaluate its possible implementation in all the plant.
